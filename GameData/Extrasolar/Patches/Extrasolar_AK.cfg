			@description = Valentine is a small red dwarf star, orbiting about the much larger and brighter star Archangel. Valentine has several planets of its own, some of which may provide a suitable refuge from Archangel. Soon, Kerbalkind will be forced to leave the system that they have spent their entire history within, and venture off into the depths of interstellar space.

        {
			@description = Fust is a planet very similar to Solitude. It has a thick atmosphere that is rich in oxygen and is mainly covered in water, with small mountainous islands peppering its surface. Solitude will only provide a short respite from the flames of Archangel. Fust could provide a more permanent home for Kerbalkind.

        {
			@description = Kuprus is a world similar to Solitude as it was four billion years ago. Instead of the iron that gives Solitude its characteristic red color, Kuprus has an abundance of copper mixed in with its soil. It seems as though the Kerbals have finally found a new source of mint ice cream

	@Body[Javine]
	{
		@Properties
        {
			@description = It is so cold here that substances that are found as gases on Solitude, form frozen hills and vast lakes on Javine. Although Javine's interior is warmed by the tidal forces of Lomina, its atmosphere is too thin to trap that warmth, making Javine a frozen, inhospitable world. Javine is not ideal for a species fleeing a dying star.
